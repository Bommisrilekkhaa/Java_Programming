if u know how many iterations to do , use for loop
else use while loop

-> variables can be initialized inside the loop

1. even number program ( in loop i+=2)

write a java prgm to find frst 6 odd numbers divisible by 7

start = (start%2)?start+1:start;
i=start;i<=n;i+=2
if(c<6)
if(i%7==0)
print
c++
else
break
